# MIPS-Simulator

This is my COL216 course project.
A detailed MIPS Interpretor that shows the activity at each clock cycle has been made where Multiple programs can be run simultaneously on different cores. 
Also Optimisations and reorderingg are performed at various stage to reduce cycle count.
The assignemnts are continuation of previous one.
