How To Run:

For main.cpp :
Put the test cases in a file named “input.txt” in the same folder in which the main.cpp file is
present.
Compile the file with “g++ -o main main.cpp” command. Executable “main.exe” is created
Run the executable by typing “main.exe arg1 arg2 arg3” in command line.
arg1 is for row access delay, arg2 is for row access delay, and arg3 is for executing a particular part of assignment (arg3=1 executes part1 and arg3=0 executes part2).
(Wrong command line arguments may generate garbage outputs).
Output is printed in the console.

For codeblocks project (mips_processor) :
Have a file “input.txt” with mips program in the codeblocks project folder. 
Set command line arguments as mentioned above by going in Projects->Set program’s arguments (in codeblocks interface).
Build and run.
