How To Run:

From main.cpp :
Put the test cases in a file named “input.txt” in the same folder in which the main.cpp file is present.
Compile the file with “g++ -o main main.cpp” command. Executable “main.exe” is created.
Run the executable by typing “main.exe arg1 arg2” in command line.
arg1 is for row access delay, arg2 is for col access delay
(Wrong command line arguments may generate garbage outputs).
Output is printed in the console.

From codeblocks project (mipsdramordering) :
Have a file “input.txt” with mips program in the codeblocks project folder.
Set command line arguments as mentioned above by going in Projects->Set program’s arguments (in codeblocks interface).
Build and run.
